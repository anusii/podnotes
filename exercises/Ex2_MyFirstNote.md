# Exercise 2: My First Note

This exercise will show you how to create a note in the Podnotes app.

## Login

Open the Podnotes app ([web app](https://Podnotes.solidcommunity.au/)) and login with your webID.

(If you have flutter installed, you could also build and run the app locally on your machine.)



## Make a Note

By default, the Podnotes app opens on the create new note page, or you can get to this page by selecting `Home` in the menu.

In `Note Title`` field, enter a title for your note.

Below the Note Title field, enter the text of your note using markdown.

Click `Save` button to save your note. (Note: the app is not auto saving in the background, although that can be implemented in flutter).

After saving, you wil see an empty new note page.

Open the menu and click `My Notes` to view your saved notes.
