This exercise provides resources to get started developings PODs based apps with Flutter.
You will have the opportunity to build and run the Podnotes app on your local machine, and add features to the Podnotes app.

You do not need to run a Solid server, as the Podnotes app uses the Community Solid Server open source software running on the Solid Community AU server https://pods.solidcommunity.au


## Install Flutter and Podnotes<a name="install"></a>

To get setup, you will need to install Flutter, including setting up flutter for your development platform, and install the Podnotes app (follow the [Install Flutter and Podnotes in repo README](../README.md#install)).


## Test run Flutter<a name="test_flutter"></a>

Check your flutter install by running the flutter demo app on your preferred device - see [Test drive flutter]
(https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal)


## Make changes to the Podnotes app<a name="edit_podnotes"></a>

Now run the Podnotes app.

```
flutter run -d [your_device]
```

Open the Podnotes repo in your favourite editor.

Edit some text in the app, by searching and changing that text in your editor. Press `R` to hot restart the app to see your changes.


### Tackle a Podnotes issue<a name="podnotes_issue"></a>

Now you can have a go at contributing to an issue in the Podnotes repo. Create a branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Feel free to also log an issue, providing details of your platform and how to replicate the problem.

*Congratulations, you are now part of the Solid Community!!*
