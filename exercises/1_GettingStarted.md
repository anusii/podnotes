# Exercise 1: Getting Started using PODs with the podnotes app

This exercise will show you how to create a POD on the solid server host https://solidcommunity.au/ and how to use the podnotes app to create and save notes to your POD.

## Setup

Option 1: Open the [podnotes web app](https://podnotes.solidcommunity.au/) or the binary for your OS.



Option 2: If you already have `flutter` installed and setup to build to `chrome`, your desktop platform, or simulators, you may run the app locally on your machine.

```
flutter devices
flutter run -d [your device]
```
